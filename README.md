# pinterest

This was a team project done at the end of August at the Nashville Software School. 

Team consisted of four individuals, and task was to build a Pinterest replica using AngularJS.

To view the final product you'll need to do the following:

* 1. Fork the repository
* 2. Ensure you have npm and bower installed.
* 3. Open Terminal 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sethdorris/pinterest.git
cd pinterest/lib
npm init
npm install
bower init
bower install
```

npm and bower will install all of the dependencies used in the project. 

* 4. Run a simple HTTP Server in order to serve the projet.

`bash
python -m simpleHTTPServer 8000
`
* 5. Open browser and navigate to localhost:8000
